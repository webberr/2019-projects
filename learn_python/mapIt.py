# Gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard.
# Opens the web browser to the Google Maps page for the address.
# This means your code will need to do the following:
# Read the command line arguments from sys.argv.
# Read the clipboard contents.
# Call the webbrowser.open() function to open the web browser.

import webbrowser
